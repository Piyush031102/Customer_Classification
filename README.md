# Customer Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying customers into different segments using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses understand their customer base better and apply targeted marketing strategies.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains demographic and behavioral information about customers. The features include:

- **Gender**: Male or Female
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Income in thousands
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior
- **Profession**: Profession of the customer (e.g., Artist, Engineer, Doctor)
- **Work Experience**: Years of work experience
- **Family Size**: Number of family members
- **Var_1**: An anonymized categorical variable
- **Segmentation**: Target variable (Customer Segment - A, B, C, D)

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution plots
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Class balance checks

3. **Model Building**
   - Machine Learning models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.
   - Train/Test split for evaluation

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve (if applicable)

5. **Feature Importance & Insights**
   - Identify top features contributing to customer segmentation
